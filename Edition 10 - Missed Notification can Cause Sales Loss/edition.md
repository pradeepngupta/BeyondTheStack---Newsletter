# How a Missed Notification Cost a Sale: A Real-Life Tech Fumble That Businesses Shouldn’t Repeat


In May, I had planned a peaceful trip to Coorg — the land of misty hills and lush coffee estates. As early as March, I had my resort booked. The only thing left? A reliable taxi to take me there.

Wanting to try a new vendor this time, I did a quick Google search and found a promising service. Booking was easy — I even opted to pay after the trip. But life happened. Work got hectic. And as the trip neared, I couldn’t recall which taxi service I had chosen.

I frantically searched my email, SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram... nothing. No booking confirmation. No follow-ups. No trace. So I assumed the booking didn’t go through.

I booked another vendor. And this time, within seconds, I received a crisp booking confirmation. Then came follow-up messages — gentle nudges about the trip, sightseeing options, and what to expect. It felt seamless. Reassuring. Professional.

One day before my trip, a surprise message popped up — it was the **original taxi vendor** with driver details.

**Too late.** They had lost a customer.

**The takeaway?**

A robust notification system isn’t optional — it’s mission-critical.

* **No notifications = lost customers.**
* **Too many irrelevant notifications = annoyed users.**
* **Well-timed, meaningful, and helpful notifications = customer trust and retention.**

**Is your system set up to build confidence — or confusion?**
